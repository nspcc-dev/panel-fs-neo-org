# Overview

NeoFS panel showcases NeoFS storage using REST API Gateway as a bridge. This web application is built with React
framework under the hood and includes:

- Deposit and withdraw NeoFS contract
- Manage containers: all CRUD operations are available
- Manage objects: create objects with custom attributes, show them and delete
- Manage ACL and extended ACL fluently

# Requirements

- docker
- make
- node (`14+`)

# Quick Start

Clone repo:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/nspcc-dev/panel-fs-neo-org.git
```

Set variables in `.env` file

- `REACT_APP_WC_PROJECT_ID` - WalletConnect project id (Can be obtained on WalletConnect website,
  see https://cloud.walletconnect.com/app)
- `REACT_APP_URL` - Web application url
- `REACT_APP_RESTGW` - [NeoFS REST Gateway](https://github.com/nspcc-dev/neofs-rest-gw), which we use to manage
  containers and object in neofs (control path)
- `REACT_APP_NETWORK` - Network of the Neo (might be `mainnet`, `testnet`)
- `REACT_APP_NEOFS_ACCOUNT` - Neo3 address of the NeoFS contract

Run next commands from project's root:

```shell
$ make
```

To run development build run:

```shell
$ make start
```

Optionally you can specify `PORT=3000`.

## Locally

You can easily run the node locally in a docker container using [@nspcc-dev/neofs-aio](https://github.com/nspcc-dev/neofs-aio).

You need to update the parameters in the `.env` file to make it work:

```env
REACT_APP_RESTGW=http://localhost:8090/v1
```

# Make instructions

* Compile the build using `make` (will be generated in `panel.fs.neo.org` dir)
* Start app using `make start` (PORT=3000 by default)
* Clean up cache directories using `make clean`
* Get release dir with tar.gz using `make release`

```shell
$ make docker/start
```

# Getting started
